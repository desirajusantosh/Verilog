 Digital Peak Detector
 RZ (return to zero )circuit
 Divide frequency by 3/2 (2 fsms working on posedge and negedge)
 Design a FSM (Finite State Machine) to detect more than one "1"s in last 3 samples. 
For example: If the input sampled at clock edges is 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 
then output should be 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 as shown in timing diagram.

And yes, you have to design this FSM using not more than 4 states!!
 
 Max frequency of DFF-Logic-DFF
 1/tdff + td2 + tsetup
